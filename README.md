tunlr-style-dns-unblocking
==========================

**Attention: the proxy list is outdated and as of May 2015, many services don't work anymore (including the demo proxy server). Since the underlying ideas are still valid, I'm leaving the project here as a reference but won't update it anymore.**

**For an easier to install and more recent alternative:**

Since Tunlr.net closed down unexpectedly, I decided to publish my ideas and findings on the subject of DNS unblocking. I used Tunlr for some time when I decided to develop my own, private DNS unblocking solution. I'm using a combination of Dnsmasq and HAProxy. Because IPv4 addresses are getting more and more expensive, I'm focusing on solutions that require just a single public IP address. You will have to compile HAProxy on your own if you don't get a version >= 1.5 using yum/apt-get. Alternatively, you can get a recent HAProxy binary from a (untrusted) repository: http://haproxy.debian.net. Make sure the JSON-Library is available for PHP.

THIS IS NOT A TUTORIAL!

The configuration generator (genconf.php) offers three different modes:
- pure-sni (Simple Setup)
- non-sni (Advanced Setup)
- local (Advanced Setup)

I'm currently running a HAProxy-based DNS-unblocker on 199.204.184.146 so you can start with your DNS forwarder setup first and add your own HAProxy server later. This server supports the pure-sni mode only.
Here's a tester which may help while deploying your own DNS unblocking solution:

#### pure-sni (Simple Setup)

Use this setup if all your multimedia players are SNI-capable.

Requires a U.S. based server (a 128 MB low end VPS is enough) and preferrably a local Dnsmasq DNS forwarder. DD-WRT routers or a Raspberry Pi will do. You could run Dnsmasq on the remote server as well but it's not recommended for security and latency reasons.

In pure-sni mode, you don't have to worry about the dnat_base_ip, dnat_base_port and loopback_base_ip options. Those options are not used, just leave them at their defaults. Make sure iptables_location points to the iptables executable and enter your VPS' IP address in haproxy_bind_ip. Make sure the ports 80 and 443 on your VPS are not being used by some other software like Apache2. Use ```netstat -tulpn``` to make sure.

For this mode, call the generator like this:
```php genconf.php pure-sni```

The generator will create two files based on the information in json.config:
- haproxy.conf
- dnsmasq-haproxy.conf

#### non-sni (Advanced Setup)

non-sni mode enables DNS-unblocking for multimedia players (or applications) which can't handle SNI but still using just a single IP address using some netfilter trickery. See here for more information on this mode:

Non-conclusive list of devices which don't understand SNI:
- Xbox 360 
- PS3
- All Sony Bravia TVs and Blu-ray players 
- Older Samsung TVs

#### local (Advanced Setup)

local mode enables DNS-unblocking on a single device which can't handle SNI but still using just a single IP address and without using another server on the network.
The generator will create four files based on the information in json.config:
- haproxy.conf (for the remote server)
- netsh-haproxy.cmd (for Windows)
- rinetd-haproxy.conf (for Linux)
- hosts-haproxy.txt (for Linux/Windows)

For Windows:
- Run notepad as administrator and open %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts (usually c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts), copy the contents of hosts-haproxy.txt
- Run netsh-haproxy.cmd as administrator

- To reset: delete contents of %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts, run as administrator 'netsh interface portproxy reset'

For Linux:
- Run 'sudo tee -a /etc/hosts < hosts-haproxy.txt' (or append hots-haproxy.txt to /etc/hosts)
- Run 'sudo cp rinetd-haproxy.conf /etc/rinetd.conf && sudo service rinetd start'

- To reset: 'sudo sed -i '/### GENERATED/d' /etc/hosts' and 'sudo service rinetd stop && sudo rm /etc/rinetd.conf'
